## <a name="introduction">ðŸ¤– Introduction</a>
I built and deployed a stunning cocktail website using React and Tailwind CSS, focusing on a scroll-driven experience powered by GSAP. I incorporated dynamic SplitText reveals, smooth parallax scrolling, and scroll-triggered effects with ScrollTrigger. I also added pinned animations, scroll-synced video playback, scroll-based image masking, and a custom animated carousel. The site features seamless timeline animations across sections and is fully responsive across all screen sizes.
